Tic-Tac-Toe, in Java
====================

Writing a little engine that gives the user the
possibility of playing the classic *Tic-Tac-Toe*.
It's implemented in Java since I feel quite
confortable with that language and with OOP-concepts,
at the moment of this writing at least.

*Note*: Program still does not give you the chance
of playing. It's on developement!

**Sample output**:


    Player@13caecd, Last choice: (1,1)
    Player@f84386, Last choice: (2,3)
    X| |X
    =====
     | |O
    =====
     | | 
    =====

You can simply launch it via `go`, a script
provided in this repository.
