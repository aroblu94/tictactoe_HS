Tic-Tac-Toe, in Java
====================

Writing a little engine that gives the user the
possibility of playing the classic *Tic-Tac-Toe*.
It's implemented in Java since I feel quite
confortable with that language and with OOP-concepts,
at the moment of this writing at least.

*Note*: Program's kept not-compilable by intent
since it's on progress.
