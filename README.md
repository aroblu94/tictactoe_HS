Tic-Tac-Toe, in Java
====================

Writing a little engine that gives the user the
possibility of playing the classic *Tic-Tac-Toe*.
It's implemented in Java since I feel quite
confortable with that language and with OOP-concepts,
at the moment of this writing at least.

*Note*: Program still does not give you the chance
of playing. It's on developement!

Current output:

    Player@1037c71, Last choice: (1,1)
    Player@1df073d, Last choice: (2,3)
    (1,1) -> *
    (1,2) -> null
    (1,3) -> *

    (2,1) -> null
    (2,2) -> null
    (2,3) -> *

    (3,1) -> null
    (3,2) -> null
    (3,3) -> null
